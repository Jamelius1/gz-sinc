Great job! HTML and BBCode also work for formatting – to learn more, [try this tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help) :nerd:

Can you try quoting me when you reply, so I know exactly which part you’re replying to?

Select the text of whichever &uarr; quote you prefer, and then press the **Quote** button that pops up over your selection – or the **Reply** button at the bottom of this post.

Below the quote, type a word or two about why you picked that one, because I’m curious :thinking:
